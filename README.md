# üõçÔ∏è E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis: Unlocking Business Insights
An in-depth data analytics project to dissect e-commerce sales data, revealing critical business insights regarding customer behavior, sales trends, and product profitability.

## üéØ Main Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to transform raw sales data into actionable intelligence that can drive strategic decision-making. We aim to identify key performance indicators (KPIs), seasonal patterns, and underlying factors influencing both sales volume and profit margins.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Libraries Used
‚Ä¢ Programming Language: Python (Core scripting and analysis).

‚Ä¢ Data Manipulation: Pandas (Data cleaning and transformation).

‚Ä¢ Scientific Computing: NumPy (Numerical operations).

‚Ä¢ Data Visualization: Plotly Express & Graph Objects (Interactive and professional charting).

‚Ä¢ Environment: Jupyter Notebook (Iterative analysis and documentation).

## üß† Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases expertise in the full data analytics lifecycle:

‚Ä¢ Data Wrangling & Cleaning: Handling file encoding, checking for missing values, and performing data type conversions (e.g., converting 'Order Date' and 'Ship Date' columns to datetime format).

‚Ä¢ Feature Engineering: Creating essential time-based features (Order Month, Order Year, Order Day of Week) for time-series analysis.

‚Ä¢ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Calculating descriptive statistics and performing monthly sales/profit analysis to identify seasonality and trends.

‚Ä¢ Segmented Performance Analysis: Deep diving into data segmented by Product Category, Sub-Category, and Customer Segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).

‚Ä¢ Profitability Metrics: Calculating the critical Sales-to-Profit Ratio to evaluate the efficiency of different customer segments.

‚Ä¢ Data Storytelling: Translating analytical findings into clear, impactful visual and textual summaries.

## ‚ú® Key Insights & Actionable Recommendations
‚Ä¢ Sales Seasonality (Key Insight): Sales and profit peak sharply in November and December (Q4), driven by holiday demand.

‚Ä¢ Recommendation: Focus Q4 Inventory & Marketing. Ensure robust inventory and launch aggressive, targeted marketing campaigns during the final two months of the year.

‚Ä¢ Top/Bottom Profit Drivers (Key Insight): Technology is the highest profit category. Conversely, Furniture has the lowest profit margin, and Tables/Supplies generate negative profit.

‚Ä¢ Recommendation: Strategic Profit Improvement. Prioritize high-profit technology promotions. Immediately investigate the cost/discount structure for 'Tables' and 'Supplies' to stem losses.

‚Ä¢ Customer Performance (Key Insight): The Consumer segment drives the highest absolute Sales and Profit. However, the Home Office segment is the most efficient, showing the best Sales-to-Profit Ratio (~7.13).

‚Ä¢ Recommendation: Acquisition Focus. Maintain strong focus on the Consumer base, but shift acquisition efforts towards the highly profitable Home Office segment for better ROI.

## üìä Project Highlights
The accompanying Jupyter Notebook (E-commerce Sales Data Analysis.ipynb) includes the complete, executed workflow, featuring:

Monthly Trend Visualizations: Line charts illustrating the clear seasonality of sales and profit.

Category/Sub-Category Breakdowns: Interactive pie and bar charts showing the sales and profit distribution across the product hierarchy.

Segment Comparison: Bar charts comparing total Sales and Profit volumes across Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments.
